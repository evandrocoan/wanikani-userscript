Autoplay audio sentences in vocabulary's reading reviews and extra lessons, with customizability.

By default, audio sentences are taken from the same API as https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-anime-context-sentences/54003 but optimized for autoplaying, e.g. after vocabulary audio, with series priorities, randomization.

Sometimes the result isn't accurate for the vocabulary, so I add an option to normalize with Anki's database. (via [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159); tried on Brave browser, and Brave Shield needs to be down.)
