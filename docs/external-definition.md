On various WaniKani pages, the script displays J->J definitions of kanji from Kanjipedia and of vocab words from Weblio.

Originally developed by polv, but he doesn't actively use WaniKani anymore.

Get [a new version of the script at GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/376666-wanikani-external-definition).

So if you have an old version of the script (version 0.5 or below) please upgrade to the new version.
**Note:** You cannot simply update your script because the script author has changed, therefore technically it is a new script. Please delete the old script from your computer and install the new version from scratch. Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience!

[details="Version history for the new version"]
**0.10:** Displays the kanji readings from Kanjipedia on the kanji, lesson and review pages.

**0.9:** Bugfix: Accidentally scraping scripts from weblio leads to a blank WaniKani page.

**0.8:** Adapted script to new weblio page structure (which prevented the script from finding any information).

**0.7:** General cleanup, bugfixes, layout improvements.

**0.6:** Initial "new" release. Hotfix for [an issue that can lead to error 429](https://community.wanikani.com/t/errorrate-limit-exceededcode429/32851/26) "Rate limit exceeded"
