On various WaniKani pages, the script displays J->J definitions of Kanji from Kanjipedia and of vocab words from Weblio. Weblio results with suitable reading and Part-of-Speech are shown first.

In addition, various radicals can be deemed Kanji, as well as some Kanji aren't in Kanjipedia, so fixed accordingly. (Weblio aggregates from various sources including Wiktionary and Wikipedia.)

If you have an old version of the script (version 0.10 or below) please upgrade to the new version. [[Change Notes](https://community.wanikani.com/t/userscript-wanikani-external-definition-from-weblio-jp-and-kanjipedia/22834/34?u=polv)]

**Note:** You cannot simply update your script because the script namespace has changed, therefore technically it is a new script. Please delete the old script from your computer and install the new version from scratch. Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience!
